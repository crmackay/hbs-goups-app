# hbs-goups-app
a test application for sample HBS grupos app

## Ideas:

to solve one thing: a calendar and contact list for group work with HBS in La Romana

### to get adoption:
- on the ground partners need to use it to track group visits
- then groups need to enter/update their information

1. components
  - group database
    - with associated contacts and metadata
  - fillable spreadsheet view (so local partners can fill out schedule)
    - [see js table here](http://handsontable.com/)
  - webform so groups can submit their week "reservation"
